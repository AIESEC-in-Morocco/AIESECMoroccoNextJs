                Yes, you are responsible for obtaining your own flight tickets.
                Being insured is a requirement for going abroad with AIESEC,

                going abroad for the whole duration of your exchange. AIESEC
                will assist you with obtaining your visa, however it is your
                responsibility to obtain the visa and pay for it on your own.
