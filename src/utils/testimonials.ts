      "Going to India for a volenteering program with AIESEC was one of the biggest challenges for me, since it was my first time travelling alone to another country and I don't regret this choice at all.\nI can't deny that it was perfect but also challenging. I learned that you always need to take the risk  and to accept the consequences but also to take the initiative and not to be scared to do so, I learned how to be organized and to not procrastinate since i had a project to work on and to submit before dely. In term of fun,i had so much fun, i met new faces and i made new friends that i would never forget, but most important thing is that i made memories.",
